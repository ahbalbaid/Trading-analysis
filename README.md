This was an old project that I made to try to predict the stock market using taylor series
the goal of this project was to build a program for digital trading

First in task 1,
  I made a program that can organize and separate the data from "ETH.csv" and calculate the rate of change in the interval that the user input to write it in file "resultETH.csv" with the time if in this the value of the second hour is lower.
  I also uploaded charts to illustrate the result of this program and edited the program so that the user can input the minimum rate of change so the computer will know where to stop. 
  I tried 0.5% as a minimum rate of change and you can see the results in:
  part 1, each vertical column represent "A" or first state
  part 1, each vertical column represent "B" or second state

  The goal of this task was to calculate the rate of change, the percentage of the rate of change, the time and date between A and B, and write it in "resultETH.csv".
  
Then in task 2,
  I used taylor series to predict the stock by using 10 models with different degrees of polynomials. These predictions will be smootheds and marged together to get the final prediction for 3 time intervals.
